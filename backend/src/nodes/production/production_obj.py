    A class thats format a process execution time and status to be stored in an NoSQL database.]

    Properties:\n
    \t_id: Unique identifier for the process.\n
    \tcreateAt: Date and time when the process data was created.\n
    \texpireAt: Date and time when the process data will expire from database.\n
    \tmodel: Flag to group and identity different process.\n
    \tstatus: Flag to identify if the process was successful or not.\n
    \tprocess_seconds: Time in seconds that the process took to execute.\n
    \n
    methods:\n
    \tstart: Overwrite 'createAt' with actual utc timestamp.\n
    \tfinish: Calculate 'process_seconds' and 'expireAt'. Overwrite 'status' and 'model' flags.\n
    \n
    Notes:\n
    \t'process_seconds' is a float value calculated when 'finish' is called.\n
    \t'finish(model, status)' must be called to finish the process and is a magic method that returns a dict representation of the process.\n
    \t'expireAt': is calculated summing the 'expire_delay' keys with 'createAt'.\n
    \t'expire_delay' is a dict with the following keys:\n
    \t\t\tseconds: Number of seconds to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\tminutes: Minutes to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\thours: Hours to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\tdays: Days to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\tweeks: Weeks to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\tmonths: Months to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t\t\tyears: Years to add to 'createAt' to calculate 'expireAt'.\n
    \t'createAt' is a datetime object created when a new instance of this class is created.\n
